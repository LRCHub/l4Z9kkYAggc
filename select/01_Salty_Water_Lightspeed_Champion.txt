If we wait any longer we will all drown
That's what I'm hoping for, the tidal wave to be consumed
Or that I will die a heavenly current
Either that or the backlash will break my neck

Oh whilst I'm riding high, so high upon a wave
Oh man I'm riding high, so high on a wave

I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before

I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before

I'm guessing I'll get used to the hype and the taste of salty water
(I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before)
I'm guessing I'll get used to the hype and the taste of salty water
(I've dreamt about this so many times before
I've dreamt about this so many times before)
