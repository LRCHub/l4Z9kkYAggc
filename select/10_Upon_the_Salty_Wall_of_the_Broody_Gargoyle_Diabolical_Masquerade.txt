Caught in a Woodsleep
Miles Down the Crypts Beneath
Desert Sands lay Deep
Sworn to an Obscure Belief

Shapes with Serpent Faces
Watchers in Deathwish Cry
Warpzones in Mazes
Venomous Tounges in Sigh

Upon the Salty Wall of the Broody Gargoyle

Broody - Come Forward from the Salt in your Wall
Broody - A Weak Human Soul is your Call

Nightshade Serenade
Diabolical Masquerade
